# TODO

Some items Paul leaves lying around as a faster (and less committed) version of
tickets.

## Now

- Beef up documentation (Why, CDD, interop)
  - Unsafe
  - MicroPython
  - Context
  - Type hinting

## Next

- Fix the micropython render problem
- Context examples
- Make a new implementation for MicroPython

## Soon

- Redo examples to single-file with tests in tests
- Put the component factory as the one possibly expected item in context

## Eventually

- Convert to single-file, no dependency to support vendor import
- Example: middleware
  - a Helmet-style example
  - Responsive-style image updating
- Example: replacement and container-style ChainMap
- tdom-based Sphinx theme

## Done
