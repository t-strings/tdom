# TODO

Some items Paul leaves lying around as a faster (and less committed) version of tickets.

## Now

- Beef up documentation (Why, CDD, interop)

## Next

- Fix the micropython render problem
- Context examples
- Make a new implementation for MicroPython

## Soon

- Wire up middleware as in test_basic_middleware
- Redo examples to single-file with tests in tests
- Put the component factory as the one possibly expected item in context

## Eventually

- Convert to single-file, no dependency to support vendor import
- Example: middleware
- Example: replacement

## Done
